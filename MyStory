Once upon a a time,
there was a Hare proud of its speed, the Hare used to jump 
and run all over the forest and it saw the Tortise and said "hi there
tortise how is your day?why are you this slow",the Tortise replied"good
 thank youI think i can enjoy the forest better then you this way "and the
  Hare asked the Tortise for a race to see who is the fastest on the day after.
  the forest animals all heard of this news and came to watch who will win 
  the race started both aspiring to win the Hareran so fast it could not see the 
  Tortise and rested for a minute. the tortise without waiting it finished the
  race faster than the Hare.
